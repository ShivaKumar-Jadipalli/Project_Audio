0
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,580
Grips on your waist

1
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,760
Front way, back way

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,600
You know that I don't play

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,960
Streets not safe

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,420
But I never run away

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,280
Even when I'm away

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,660
Oti, Oti, there's never much love when we go, oti

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,000
I pray to make it back in one piece

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I pray, I pray

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,500
That's why I need a one dance

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,880
Got a Hennessy in my hand

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,680
One more time 'fore I go

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,000
Higher powers taking a hold on me

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,960
I need a one dance

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,600
Got a Hennessy in my hand

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,540
One more time 'fore I go

16
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,060
Its taking a hold on me

17
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,680
Strength and guidance

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,060
All that I'm wishing for my friends

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,660
Nobody makes it from my ends

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,000
I had to bust up the silence

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,820
You know you gotta stick by me

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Soon as you get a text, reply me

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,380
I don't wanna spend time fighting

24
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,240
We've got no time

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,340
That's why I need a one dance

26
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,240
Got a Hennessy in my hand

27
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,880
One more time 'fore I go

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,020
Higher powers taking a hold on me

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,760
I need a one dance

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,020
Got a Hennessy in my hand

31
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,140
One more time 'fore I go

32
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,120
Higher powers taking a hold on me
