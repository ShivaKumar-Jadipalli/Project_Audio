1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,100
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks
(*record scratch*)

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,300
Two trailer park girls
go 'round the outside

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,000
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,700
Two trailer park girls
go 'round the outside

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,500
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Guess who's back, back again

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,100
Shady's back, tell a friend

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,300
Guess who's back, guess who's back

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Guess who's back, guess who's back

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,600
Guess who's back, guess who's back

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,100
Guess who's back

12
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,200
I've created a monster,
'cause nobody wants to

13
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,300
See Marshall no more, they want
Shady, I'm chopped liver

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,600
Well, if you want Shady, this
is what I'll give ya

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,600
A little bit of weed mixed
with some hard liquor

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
Some vodka that'll jump
start my heart quicker

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,700
Than a shock when I get shocked
at the hospital

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,900
By the doctor when I'm
not co-operating

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,500
When I'm rocking the table while
he's operating (Hey!)

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,100
You waited this long,
now stop debating

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
'Cause I'm back, I'm on
the rag and ovulating

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,500
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,700
But your husband's heart
problem's complicating

24
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,500
So the FCC won't let me be

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,600
Or let me be me, so let me see

26
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,800
They try to shut me down on MTV

27
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
But it feels so empty without me

28
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,100
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Fuck that! Cum on your lips
and some on your tits

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,400
And get ready, 'cause this
shit's about to get heavy

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,700
I just settled all my lawsuits,
fuck you, Debbie!

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Now this looks like a job for me

33
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
So everybody, just follow me

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
'Cause we need a little controversy

35
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,000
'Cause it feels so empty without me

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
I said this looks like a job for me

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,300
So everybody, just follow me

38
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
'Cause we need a little controversy

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,900
'Cause it feels so empty without me

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,900
Little hellions, kids
feeling rebellious

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,700
Embarrassed their parents
still listen to Elvis

42
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,100
They start feeling like
prisoners helpless

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,600
'Til someone comes along on a
mission and yells, "Bitch!"

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,500
A visionary, vision is scary

45
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Could start a revolution,
polluting the airwaves

46
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,600
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,800
In the fact that I got everyone
kissing my ass (*smack*)

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,800
And it's a disaster,
such a catastrophe

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,400
For you to see so damn much of
my ass—you asked for me?

50
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,600
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-
na-na-na-na-na-na-na

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
Fix your bent antenna, tune
it in, and then I'm gonna

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,600
Enter in, and up under your
skin like a splinter

53
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,600
The center of attention,
back for the winter

54
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,900
I'm interesting, the best
thing since wrestling

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,100
Infesting in your kid's
ears and nesting

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Testing, "Attention please"

57
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,100
Feel the tension soon as
someone mentions me

58
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Here's my ten cents, my
two cents is free

59
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,500
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,500
Now this looks like a job for me

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
So everybody, just follow me

62
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
'Cause we need a little controversy

63
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,900
'Cause it feels so empty without me

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I said this looks like a job for me

65
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,200
So everybody, just follow me

66
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,200
'Cause we need a little controversy

67
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,400
'Cause it feels so empty without me

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,800
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll
go tit for tat with

69
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,000
Anybody who's talking "This
shit, that shit"

70
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,000
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can
get your ass kicked

71
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:56,200
Worse than them little
Limp Bizkit bastards

72
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,300
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie

73
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded
fag, blow me

74
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,700
You don't know me, you're
too old, let go

75
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
It's over, nobody listens to techno

76
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,800
Now let's go, just give me the signal

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll be there with a whole
list full of new insults

78
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,200
I've been dope, suspenseful
with a pencil

79
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
Ever since Prince turned
himself into a symbol

80
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
But sometimes the shit just seems

81
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Everybody only wants to discuss me

82
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,500
So this must mean I'm disgusting

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,700
But it's just me, I'm just obscene

84
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,900
Though I'm not the first
king of controversy

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I am the worst thing
since Elvis Presley

86
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,200
To do black music so selfishly

87
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,100
And use it to get myself
wealthy (Hey!)

88
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
There's a concept that works

89
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Twenty million other white
rappers emerge

90
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
But no matter how many fish in the sea

91
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,900
It'd be so empty without me

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,900
Now this looks like a job for me

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So everybody, just follow me

94
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
'Cause we need a little controversy

95
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
'Cause it feels so empty without me

96
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,400
I said this looks like a job for me

97
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
So everybody, just follow me

98
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,700
'Cause we need a little controversy

99
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,700
'Cause it feels so empty without me

100
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,500
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la

101
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,800
La la la la la, la la la la

102
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,100
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la

103
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,600
La la la la la, la la la la

104
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,300
Kids!
