1. read that essentialisim summary (man it is taking too long I will check that later )
2. read that matt grey post
3. re-order your notion time table again

so here is what I am going to do now : let's try to do all this by 3:00 , so time is 3:00 pm but I didn't do any of the below time just passed by, I still don't understand how this is happening
Do I have to set a clear time table right now or do I just proceed to do my project like see. I have woken up around 7 am now the time is 2 pm but right until now I haven't written a single line of new code I started working with the intention of completion but I couldn't do that why do you think that is the case, so 7 am to 2 pm that is 7 hours and in that I have opened computer only 2 hours and in that I have opened vs code only 17 mins

Others :

while dropping that raju grandpa at station he asked me " I heard that your last babaii is having an affair and that costed him 5 lakhs " I thought it was saidulu but later understood that it was nagulu so the thing is I was over thinking and skipped nagulu babaii cause I thought that raju thata now this cause nagulu case was known in out entire community. so I thought this saidulu was a secret that was kept even from him cause daddy and thata were talking about old days. and in the middle of the conversation I asked him " does all people in community were Sex Addicts " he was laughing and told him that is the reason why he married everyone at the age of 19 and also told me that his elder son was having an affair and that cost him 9 lakhs in settelment. so I thought of telling this to mom when I came home but meghana was there so I thought this wasn't the right time and when meghana left the next day I thought of telling this but I don't know I felt the moment was not right and some time later saidulu came and when talking to him mommy told him about that raju thata sons affair.
See if I were to tell mommy about this I would be seen as a bad guy and she knows all along about this but she didn't tell me and I don't know I feel like I just escaped some trouble.
